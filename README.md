# Meme-Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-Assistant
Build a web app called "Meme Stock Detector" from my project files. Unzip `replit_project.zip` into the project root first — all files live there.

WHAT IT DOES: Analyzes posts and comments in r/wallstreetbets and classifies them into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. The app will also allow you to see the change in stock price of various stocks over time, and predict what will happen based off of sentiment through
the mos recent comments and posts that we have access to.
HOW USERS INTERACT: Entering a list of tickers to display information about, the user enters a size of list k, and the top k stocks and botom k stocks by sentiment.
HOW RESULTS APPEAR: For each stock we want a graph of the stok price over time. Also display a graph of the sentiment score of the stock over time.
VISUAL STYLE: Cafe themed, lights are dim when the market is closed, but bright when market is open.

Frontend stack is up to you — Gradio, Streamlit, or React + a Python backend are all fine. Pick whichever makes the nicest app. A Python backend runs the model.

FIGURE OUT THE MODEL YOURSELF — don't assume, inspect the bundle:
- Load every file through `model_setup.paths["<filename>"]`, never by raw path. Read model_setup.py's docstring for loaders (joblib, Keras, Transformers).
- Use ALL provided files, not just the model — scalers, tokenizers, label maps, helper scripts, and data files are included because the app needs them.
- If the bundle has multiple models or data sources for different features, build a section/mode for each — don't ship just one.
- Inspect the model and any data/schema files to determine the exact input shape and output type, then build the UI to match.

INPUTS: if the bundle includes sample model data (for example a sample_images folder, or a sample data file like a .csv / .json / .npz), give users preloaded examples they can try instantly (from their real sample data), matched to the input type. Use those real samples for the built-in examples, since they come from the model's own data and match what it expects. Do not substitute stock photos, web-search results, or AI-generated images for these built-in examples, which will not match the model and give meaningless predictions. This applies only to the preloaded examples: if there's no sample data in the bundle, skip them, and if the user later asks for a feature that needs outside images or data, that's fine. If the model takes many numeric features, let users pick or tweak an example instead of typing every field.
OUTPUTS: present results clearly and visually, matched to the output type — probability bars for classification, a value card for a single number, a ranked list for recommendations. No plain unstyled text.

RUNS ON REPLIT — must do:
- Bind the server to host 0.0.0.0 and the port Replit provides (the PORT env var if set) so the web preview loads.
- Every process the app needs must start in PRODUCTION, not just development. If you split into multiple services (e.g. a Python backend), give each one a production run command, not only a development one, and confirm the published deployment launches them all. A backend with only a dev run config will fail when published.
- Install the included requirements.txt; if a pinned version conflicts with the environment, use the nearest compatible one.
- Some model files may download on first launch; show a loading state.
- CONFIGURE THE DEPLOYMENT CONFIG NOW, before finishing — not just the dev workflow. Set the deployment run command (and a build step if anything needs compiling) so the app is publishable immediately. Publishing uses the deployment config, NOT the dev Run button: if it is missing, clicking Publish fails with "Run command not found" / "Invalid run command".

VISUAL POLISH: Make it feel like a real product (based on the design choices above), not a default demo.

DONE WHEN: the app starts, the web preview loads, clicking a preloaded example returns a correct-looking result, AND the deployment config has a valid production run command so publishing works without a "Run command not found" error.
